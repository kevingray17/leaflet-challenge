# What's Shaking? 
## A weekly accounting of worldwide seismic activity

### About This Project
The Earth is alive!
Earthquakes, sometimes even though imperceptible, occir everyday around the world. Thanks to the United States Geological Service's real-time GeoJSON tool, we are able to track and map quakes in real time. This web page provides a snapshot of seizmic activity worldwide, while delivering pertinent information including location, as well as the magnitude and depth of the quake.
The next time you feel the Earth move under your feet, log on and find out what's shaking!
